Horrible monsters with `__del__`

This repository contains a number of experiments with Python's garbage collector and the __del__ magic methods, including at least some examples that cause fatal memory leaks. Execute with caution. These examples have been tested with CPython and the BPython REPL (and displays implementation-specific behaviour).
